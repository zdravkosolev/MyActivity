In this exercise we have to make a simple keyboard where it should be functional with the mouse and with the keyboard(Javascript mouse events and Javascript keyboard events).

At first part of the project I made the HTML structure of the page where I used background image where I used one container for whole page, and inside I put two divs, one for title and written letters, and other for the keyboard.
at second I styled the title, the paragraph with written numbers, and at the end I styled the keyboard buttons.
At the end of the project I used JavaScript code to perform activities to the buttons of the keyboard.
I have added life to the keyboard :)
