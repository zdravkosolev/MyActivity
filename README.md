First of all I added an array of objects where each object describes a book with its values like title,author, maximum pages and on readed pages.
After that I iterate through the array and for each element, I created the "li" elements where they should append.
I also made smiliar code for the list that I need to create where should append the full readed books and partial readed books. 
At the end I have made a form section where the user can add a book.
